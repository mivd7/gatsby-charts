# GATSBY CHARTS
This is an app with which the user can build dynamic charts based on data and calculations. Build with GatsbyJS & Highcharts JS (React & GraphQL). Please note: the .csv file the data is based on is not included in this repo. For the chart builder to work you'd have to make one yourself.
