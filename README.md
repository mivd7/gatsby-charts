## Gatsby Charts

This is an app with which the user can build dynamic charts based on data and calculations. Build with [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org/) (React & GraphQL) and using [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) for displaying the charts.<br><br> Please note: the .csv file the data is based on is not included in this repo. For the chart builder to work you'd have to make one yourself.
